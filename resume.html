        <p><i>Mission Chile Concepcion 2022-2024</i></p>
        <p>I had the wonderful priveledege of serving a full-time mission in Chile where I had the oppoetunitiy to most importantly share the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ and help other feel the love of God. I also had the experience of leading and trainging other missionaries, and mastering the Spnaish Language as i was fully emmersed in the Chilean culture. This two year experience changed who I am as a person, and will forever be grateful for the opportunity!</p>
